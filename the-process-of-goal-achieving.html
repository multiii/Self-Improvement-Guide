<p>Previously we covered a basic framework to follow for achieving goals. We will now look at a more in-depth explanation that goes over the whole process of goal seeking, and how this knowledge can immensely benefit you as well as allow you to reach goals much easier and quicker.</p>
<p>In this section, we will look at how to use your ASM (Automatic Success Mechanism) to achieve goals much more easily. By the end of this page, you will have the tools and information necessary to achieve almost any goal <strong>effortlessly</strong> and with zero stress. The word effortlessly isn’t just used as an exaggeration. You will literally need to apply almost no conscious effort in order to achieve your goals. Sounds unbelieveable? Well, it’s now time to make you believe in it.</p>
<div id="how-the-asm-works" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="10.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> How the ASM works<a href="the-process-of-goal-achieving.html#how-the-asm-works" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>You might know that birds have a survival instinct which lets them migrate safely across thousands of miles during the winter even without any prior knowledge. Similarly, humans also have a survival instinct allowing them to automatically achieve goals which haven’t been achieved before. However, the thing that sets us apart from other animals is that we can set our own goals for our goal-striving mechanism to automatically achieve.</p>
<p>All we need to do is supply the ASM with a goal, and it will automatically work towards achieving it. Infants do this all the time as they learn to do things like pick up an object, to walk, and much more. They do so by trying, making mistakes, and eventually correcting course until they succeed <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-asm">Maltz 2002a</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>When one plays a musical instrument, for eg. piano, for the first time, it’s very difficult for them to quickly play the notes in a rhythmic way, but with some practice the same difficult task becomes second nature, and they’re able to effortlessly play complicated music. The same applies for any other goal seeking situation: learning to shoot hoops, play chess, deliver persuasive speeches in front of an audience, solve the rubik’s cube, and so on. By supplying the goal, the ASM gets to work, and with enough practice it’s able to slowly chip away at the mistakes and eventually achieve the goal, with no conscious effort on your part <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-subconscious">Maltz 2002c</a>)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="goal-communication" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="10.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Goal Communication<a href="the-process-of-goal-achieving.html#goal-communication" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>To supply a goal to your ASM, you must have a very clear, well-defined image of what it is. You must know exactly what you want to achieve. Writing detailed descriptions of the goal and how you’d feel upon achieving this goal, as well as imagining yourself achieving the goal in great depth are what allow you to communicate this goal to your ASM.</p>
<p>There is immense power in goal visualization. Dr. Clark conducted an experiment to prove this fact. The experiment involved grouping 144 high school boys into different physical and mental practice groups based on arm strength, intelligence, as well as experience in their respective high-school sports divisions. In each group, the development of a certain motor skill was tested by using either physical practice or mental practice. At the end of the experiment, it was concluded that mental practice was nearly as effective as physical practice; physical practice showed an effect of 0.52, while mental practice not far behind at 0.334 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-visualization">L. Verdelle 1960</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Try to create a detailed picture in your mind of the success you wish to achieve, whether it be being able to confidentally convince a crowd of people, presenting a charismatic speech, or even scoring well on your tests. Then, spend 30 minutes per day for the next 2 weeks replaying a mental movie of yourself achieving this success and performing in your most ideal, perfect way. After 2 weeks, you will inevitably achieve success if you continue to reinforce your goal and don’t surrender to negative beliefs.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-power-of-relaxing" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="10.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> The Power of Relaxing<a href="the-process-of-goal-achieving.html#the-power-of-relaxing" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>We can eliminate the majority of stress in our daily lives if we simply delegate all of our goals to our ASM and stop caring about their outcomes. If our goals are well-defined and properly communicated to our ASM, success is inevitable and we don’t need to care about it. Moreover, caring about the outcome and stressing out about it will actually make things worse: it might cause us to develop negative thoughts and anxieties which will instead tell the ASM that the failure we so fear is actually the goal to be reached, and it might cause us to try and consciously control the goal seeking process.</p>
<p>The process of goal seeking is purely subconscious, and so, trying to exercise conscious control over it will only hurt us. We must learn to delegate goals to our ASM and stop caring or trying to control it, knowing that doing so will only make things worse; we must instead have faith and realize that the ASM has all the power necessary to make our goal a reality.</p>
<p>If negative emotions and anxieties do crop up however, we can simply focus on completely relaxing all of our muscles, since we can’t feel any negative emotions if all of our muscles are relaxed. Also, our emotions don’t depend on external conditions, but instead our reactions to them. When a telephone rings, we don’t have to pick it up; we can always choose to ignore it. Similarly, when we face an unfavorable situation, we can decide to ignore it since it doesn’t have any power over us. By choosing not to give into it, we ensure better emotional stability and well-being, allowing us to better handle tasks and work towards goals.</p>
<p>Visualizations can come in handy once again here. Whenever you find yourself stressed or angry at something, you can imagine yourself literally blowing off steam from a steam valve atop your head, or imagine yourself walking into a well-protected safe house that is in a peaceful setting and heavily fortified from all external elements.</p>
<p>These techniques of relaxation are essential to chasing success, as they allow us to better assess our situations, as well as prevent unfavorable situations from being able to have an effect on us.</p>
</div>
<div id="watching-the-thinker" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="10.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.4</span> Watching the Thinker<a href="the-process-of-goal-achieving.html#watching-the-thinker" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>A crucial realization that is often caused by, but doesn’t have to come from mindfulness meditation practice, is the fact that we don’t actually think our thoughts. The “conscious” thoughts that we seem to think in our head are actually simply another external stimulus that we perceive, just like the sights and sounds around us, as well as the emotions we experience <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thoughts">Ayan 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>By realizing this, we come to learn that we don’t have to give much importance to our thoughts or deeply believe in them, because they are simply byproducts of the mind’s conditioning, which is aimed at keeping your self-image and its narrative alive. We will also cover this is much greater detail because this is the most important topic in the entire book, and having a deep understanding of this will allow us to essentially be free of negative emotions, destroy all mind resistances at will, and experience greater happiness 24/7.</p>
<p>If we start watching our thoughts from an unbiased perspective whenever they show up, knowing that we don’t think them and that whatever they say isn’t necessarily the truth, we can make negative, belittling thoughts as well as negative emotions completely powerless. These thoughts and mind resistances are the biggest obstacle to goal seeking, as they have the ability to convince us that we can’t reach our goals, preventing us from signalling the goal to the ASM properly.</p>
<p>Whenever you feel negative emotions like fear, anxiety, worry, tension or hear negative, belittling thoughts in your head saying that you can’t do something, or that your goal isn’t realistic, simply watch the emotions and thoughts from beyond the mind without judging them. Watch them with a sense of curiosity, with the innate knowledge that you are not the thinker of these thoughts, nor are these thoughts necessarily valid. This will instantly dissolve these negative mind structures, allowing you to continue chasing your goals without having to deal with them <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-acceptance">Tolle 1999b</a>)</span>.</p>

<div id="using-emotional-steam-to-your-advantage" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="10.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.5</span> Using Emotional Steam to your Advantage<a href="the-process-of-goal-achieving.html#using-emotional-steam-to-your-advantage" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>It’s common to see people who are really good at an activity normally, but who “choke” and mess-up around other people because of being under pressure.</p>
<p>This happens because they aren’t able to use crisis situations to their advantage. When one feels nervous and tense during an important activity or performance, it is because they’ve been supplied with increased strength and wisdom to better handle the situation. The heightened emotion that one feels which seems like tension is actually just neutral “emotional steam”. This emotional steam can either be anxiety or excitement, depending on how it’s perceived. The emotion is the same, but how it’s viewed makes all the difference.</p>
<p>If the emotional steam is viewed as tension, thoughts may end up reinforcing failure as the goal instead, resulting in… failure. If it’s viewed as excitement however, and you continue to believe that you can do it, you’ll be able to achieve success.</p>
<p>You could also apply the technique of watching your emotions mentioned above in order to reduce the degree of control the emotion has over you, and to minimize its effects. We will later learn about how it might be better in the long run to adapt that instead, since it will prevent emotions from having too much control over you, allowing you to simply accept them for what they are and move on, instantly dissolving the negative feelings they cause. But if you find that technique difficult to practice for whatever reason, simply knowing that your emotional steam is just excitement which will help you achieve your goal will be useful for the goal seeking situations.</p>
<p>A final note about crisis situations and performing under pressure: when you’re learning a skill for the first time and allowing your ASM to work towards reaching the goal associated with it, working under pressure might not be the best option. Working without pressure allows your ASM create more general mind maps under a calm mental state, which can be appropriately altered and modified to suit any similar situation in the future. However, if you only work under pressure, it might not allow you to perform the skill/task during other emotional states. We should find safe ways to practice, maybe with simulated, synthetic pressure, so that you can learn effectively, and make it easier to perform during the actual situation. For example, this is what boxers do by practice punches in front of a mirror (shadow boxing).</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.6</span> The “Winning Feeling”<a href="the-process-of-goal-achieving.html#the-winning-feeling" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>When we worry about a situation going wrong, we invoke the same emotions that we would feel if that situation actually went wrong. If you continue to worry and dwell on negative emotions, the situation going wrong will become the goal and your ASM will act in accordance to those emotions. However, if you evoke feelings of success and fully capture it, you will act successfully.</p>
<p>You can reimagine past moments of success you’ve had in great detail, to fully evoke within you the feeling of success you felt once again, and then with this “winning feeling of success” imagine vivid pictures of your new goal, imagining how you would act and feel if you have already succeeded. Delving deeply into this winning feeling and visualizaing your new goal at the same time more effectively communicates the goal to your ASM, allowing you to achieve the goal a lot quicker.</p>
