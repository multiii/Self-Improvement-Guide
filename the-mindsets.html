<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 4</span> The Mindsets<a href="the-mindsets.html#the-mindsets" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>Finally, the last set of things to go over before you get into the practical stuff is going to be the mindsets to follow. Having the right frame of mind is rather important to be motivated to make progress as well as to enjoy the journey ahead. We will take a look at some mindsets to adopt and things to keep in mind before we begin.</p>
<div id="the-growth-mindset" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> The Growth Mindset<a href="the-mindsets.html#the-growth-mindset" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Understanding and adopting this mindset is crucial to your success on this journey. It is basically the idea that every goal that you want to achieve can be broken up into skills that can be acquired: if you want to become a social-leader-type person who commands respect, you can learn to improve your charisma, study leadership skills and the art of persuasion, or if you want to start scoring good grades, you can learn to pick up the right skills and use efficient study techniques along with working hard everyday to slowly make progress and become smarter <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-growth_mindset">Ng 2018</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Seeing life through this lens effectively turns it into a video game, where you’re gaining XP in new skills all the time to aid the goal-achieving process. For instance, your confidence is like a video game skill which can be leveled up by performing certain activities like approaching strangers and talking to them, or complimenting a random person.</p>
<p>Like in a video game, these skills have progressions to them. In the beginning stages of your journey relatively easy tasks will provide you with a lot of XP, but as time goes on and your skills improve, both your abilities and worthwhile challenges will equally scale up. When you’re hitting the weight room for the first time, even curling as little as 5-lb dumbbells might result in sizable muscle gains, but after some months you might need to curl 20-lb dumbbells to see an equal improvement in muscle size.</p>
<p>But the good part is that this means you can become good at almost everything given enough practice <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-deliberate_practice">Papadopoulos 2017</a>)</span>. Things such as getting top grades, becoming a social butterfly or becoming ripped are challenges that get easier as you gain more XP in their relevant skills. As you gain more and more XP in these skills, the harder challenges start to get a lot easier, helping aid how smoothly your journey goes, and eventually this journey of leveling up your skills becomes immensely fun and rewarding. It’s almost like you’re playing an actual video game.</p>
<p>Now, don’t ever think you can’t achieve any of your future goals. Seen from this perspective it becomes clear that achieving your goals is ultimately inevitable. If you’re ever playing a video game and get stumped by a challenging level, you don’t say to yourself, <em>“This level is so hard, I’ll never be able to complete it.”</em> You eventually persevere and figure it out, or maybe you watch an online tutorial and finish it. Either way, your goals are attainable in the same way if you simply believe in yourself and continue leveling up.</p>
</div>
<div id="progressive-overload" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Progressive Overload<a href="the-mindsets.html#progressive-overload" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>We went over how harder challenges get easy with time as you gain more XP and level up. You need to make sure that you constantly keep increasing the bar and going after more difficult challenges though, since the same easy challenges won’t give you a similar jump in XP levels like they did back when they were harder.</p>
<p>There’s a sweet spot between overly hard challenges and challenges that are too easy. This goldilocks zone is hit when the challenge is high, but so are your skills. The emotion that is felt when you tackle such a challenge is called the “Flow State” (also known as “Being in the Zone”), and is extremely sought after by creative workers, athletes, and others belonging to many other spheres. This is because the Flow State is extremely rewarding: it results in a sense of fluidity between your mind and body, time begins to slow down, you feel at union with the task and your senses are heightened <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-flow">Dimitri, Mattie, and Arnold 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Try your best to chase that sweet spot, and continue to level up your skills as well as raise the challenge that you decide to face whenever you’re doing a task or working towards a goal.</p>
</div>
<div id="taking-initiative" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Taking Initiative<a href="the-mindsets.html#taking-initiative" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The primary way to level up your confidence skill is to take initiative and move outside your comfort zone. Do you feel anxious in social settings? Go up to a random stranger and talk about literally anything. –? –. –? –. No one cares if it ends up being awkward or if you mess up. In fact, the more awkward it feels, the better it is for you since you gain more confidence XP the more uncomfortable it is. This is because, once you break the resistance and do the task, it becomes 2x easier to do the next time, and 2x more the time after that, and so on.</p>
<p>Action cures fear <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-action_cures_fear">Schwartz 2007b</a>)</span>. By actively choosing to move out of your comfort zone you get rid of the fear that comes with thinking about that activity. This opens up a lot more doors and allows you to do things that you could only previously dream of. And yes, it will be hard in the beginning, and you’ll be tempted to not do it, out of fear, out of anxiety, out of compulsion. But everytime you break out of that mysterious force and take action, it’s like you gain 5 whole levels in this skill. Taking initiative allows you to regain control over your life and prevents fear from dictating your life choices. And the best part is that right after you do such an uncomfortable activity, massive waves of relief and satisfaction wash over you like you’ve never felt before.</p>
<p>Given enough time on this journey, your commitment will force you to take the leap and move out of your comfort zone often. It is only by doing so that you can progress in certain aspects, since it destroys our biggest opponent on this journey, <strong>the resistances of our own mind</strong>. Eventually, the feeling of fulfillment provided by moving out of your comfort zone will result in you seeking its thrill at every oppurtunity. It’s almost exactly like riding a rollercoaster. At first you’re scared of even the mere thought of going on one, but given enough rides, you soon develop a deep enjoyment for them and can’t wait for your next ride on one.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-power-of-belief" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.4</span> The Power of Belief<a href="the-mindsets.html#the-power-of-belief" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Something that becomes more apparent the longer you are on this journey, is the fact that negative thought patterns and emotions are really the biggest obstacle we have on this journey. It’s the suppresive beliefs saying that <em>“You can’t do it”</em>, or <em>“That’s not a realistic goal”</em> that keep us stuck in mediocrity.</p>
<p>We must learn to harness the power of belief, because if you deeply believe that something can be done, the mind finds ways to do so <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-power_of_belief">Schwartz 2007a</a>)</span>. This isn’t just plain talk, but something that has been scientifically proven. There is true power in belief. You’ve probably heard of the placebo effect <em>(if not, go look it up)</em>: the power of belief is strong enough to cure whole diseases and illnesses <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-placebo_effect">Seladi-Schulman 2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>So, truly believe in yourself, and know that your goals can be achieved easily if you wholeheartedly follow this guide and the journey it will take you on.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-asm" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> The ASM<a href="the-mindsets.html#the-asm" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>There is so much power in belief because of a little something known as the Automatic Success Mechanism (The ASM). The ASM is a subconscious mechanism that all humans possess, and it’s primary function is goal seeking. By providing it with a well-defined goal, it works hard to make that goal a reality <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-asm">Maltz 2002a</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>By believing that something can be achieved, and deeply invoking the feelings you’d feel if you were to have achieved that goal, the goal is signaled to your ASM and it begins to work towards it. Failures and mistakes at this stage are useful to us, because they tell the ASM what <strong>NOT</strong> to do, enabling it to correct course and get closer to success next time.</p>
<p>This is the same principle used by homing missiles, and even in basic tasks like learning to pick up a pencil or catch a fly ball.</p>
<p>We will cover the ASM in a lot more detail further down this guide, but for now just keep in mind that you have at your disposal an extremely powerful device that will automatically help you achieve all your goals, and all you need to do is select the goals and believe that you can achieve them. If you want to learn more about this goal-seeking theory and how to implement it in your daily life, you can also read the bestselling book that this is taken from: <a href="https://ia601903.us.archive.org/26/items/TheNewPsychoCyberneticsByMaxwellMaltz1/The%20New%20Psycho-Cybernetics%20by%20Maxwell%20Maltz%20%20%281%29.pdf">Psycho-Cybernetics</a>, although we will cover the important aspects of it in lesser detail in this guide as well.</p>
</div>
<div id="enjoy-it-while-it-lasts" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="4.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> Enjoy it while it lasts<a href="the-mindsets.html#enjoy-it-while-it-lasts" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Ultimately, beyond all of these mindsets and principles, this is the <strong>MOST IMPORTANT</strong>. You’re now embarking on a life changing journey, and eventually your older self is going to look back at your present efforts with pride and gratefulness.</p>
<p>It’s extremely important to savor every moment in the present fully, in order to remember how it all feels: your goals, your struggles, and you overcoming the struggles in order to continue on stronger. As weird as this sounds, in the future you’re going to miss the struggles and small challenges that you might face, as well as the victories that will eventually build up to your success of course. So don’t shy away from anything and accept everything that comes your way fully. Know that all your wins and losses will only carry you towards success, and nothing else.</p>
<p>Apart from all that, savoring the present moment fully is the essential ingredient to happiness. Trying to escape from the present and harboring mental resistance is what causes all sorts of negative disorders like depression, anxiety, and so on <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-savoring">Tolle 1999a</a>)</span>. By fully accepting everything that comes in your life from here on out, not only will you become resistant to all challenges and lead a fully positive life, but you will also remember with great detail the beginning of your journey that will go on to provide you with unimaginable success.</p>
<p>I know all of this might sound like cheap motivational talk to get you to feel better, but there really is truth in every single word of what I said.
