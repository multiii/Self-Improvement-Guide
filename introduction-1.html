<p>But don’t just take my word for it. Me along with many others have found true success and happiness through this journey, and my goal with this website is to guide you along the same path I took in order for you to attain the same treasures everyone’s seeking.</p>
<p>Below are a few testimonials from other fellow travelers who’ve walked the same path and attained similar success.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>“Life before self-improvement for me wasn’t great. I’d spend gloomy days in the darkness of my room, dreading to do anything since I was so devoid of motivation. This made me sluggish and hopeless. I wanted to get things done, feel a sense of accomplishment and just be happy, but all I could do was sit motionless on my couch all day and watch YouTube non-stop while eating junk food. I had dreams of building a great physique, learning martial arts, and transforming myself… and although I told myself that I wanted to do these things, I continued wallowing in the miserable comfort of my home without taking any steps towards my goals. I felt as if I was tied down and not able to take any steps forward. <br> <br>
But when I got on self-improvement, things slowly began changing. I finally had a direction in my life, a road map ahead of me to follow. I didn’t work towards anything previously since deep down I had confirmed it in my mind that happiness was a myth and nothing could be done to help me. But simply the act of doing things like meditating and working out showed me that there was so much more to life. One can only understand how liberating and vibrant life can get once they get on this journey. I was able to effortlessly quit my life of cheap gratification and instead pursue one that kept me happy and hopeful for the future 24/7. And I know there are still millions of people out there who faced the same conditions as me, and although they still might not be moved by my story, let me tell you that change can be made, all you need is someone to guide you along.” - Anonymous</p></li>
<li><p>“I used to be sad and depressed all the time, but since 2020, I’ve been working on myself; I’ve devoted myself to a mission, and so I’ve seen enormous gains in my life. <br> <br> Over this time, I’ve been able to: sit down doing nothing for upto 3 hours, kill social media FOMO, destroy addictions / neuroticism i used to have, become more confident in my abilities, read plenty of great books, not be so weak and puny lol, meet and network with some amazing people, learn French, build some pretty cool projects/apps. <br> <br>
And all just by cutting out the stupid bs in my life, and instead focusing on what matters to me. Today, I’m running a business and I’m motivated to work every single day.” - Aban</p></li>
<li><p>“I lost 40kg (80+ Pounds), improved my mental health through meditation, journaling and practicing gratitude. That way I got rid of my dark depression and bad anxiety. I read over 40+ books in one year and learned a lot in all different areas of life. I also started different hobbies and was open for new things and experiences. Today I’m the owner of the official Self-Improvement Germany Discord server and my team and I try our best to help out our brothers and sisters which are struggling with life, like I ways, just a few years ago.” - KazuyaHH</p></li>
