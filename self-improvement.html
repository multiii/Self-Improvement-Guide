<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 2</span> Self Improvement<a href="self-improvement.html#self-improvement" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>Self Improvement may seem like a mystical solution-to-all-your-problems, as it seems to have the ability to provide unimaginable success and totally transform your life… which is exactly what it did for me and numerous other indviduals.</p>
<p>But what exactly is Self Improvement? Before setting off on any journey, we must have a plan and general idea of where we’re going, along with why we’re going there. I’m going to start off by going over what Self-Improvement is and what it isn’t, along with some more basic information to clear the basics.</p>
<div id="what-is-self-improvement" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> What is Self Improvement<a href="self-improvement.html#what-is-self-improvement" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Simply put, Self Improvement is a set of habits, practices and mindsets aimed at improving <em>(well obviously)</em> every aspect of your life. Anything and everything that can help improve any aspect of your life is a part of this program, and so, embarking upon this journey primes you for success in multiple ways. The core purpose of Self Improvement, in my mind, is to enable one to be completely happy with their life and have the ability to work on improving anything, to work towards developing any skill, or to work on any difficult task, while enjoying and wholeheartedly accepting every bit of it.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-self-improvement-isnt" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> What Self Improvement isn’t<a href="self-improvement.html#what-self-improvement-isnt" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Although Self Improvement allows you to make unimaginable progress and totally reinvent yourself, this doesn’t mean that all of these benefits will come immediately. Like anything, even this process takes time and effort… although applying some of the later mentioned principles do make the whole ordeal a lot easier and a lot more fun.</p>
<p>However, don’t expect to turn into a God who no longer makes mistakes, or someone who no longer has room to grow or develop whatsover. Upon spending quite some time on this journey, you will soon come to the realization that everything and everyone always has the potential to improve and exceed its limits. Self Improvement in this sense, is more of a lifelong journey than a one time ticket to absolute, complete success. However, rest assured that you will find the lifelong journey quite fulfilling, as it will always keep you occupied with some new challenge to overcome or some new goal to reach, which as you will come to learn is quite intrinsically rewarding.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-self-improvement-will-do-for-you" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> What Self Improvement will do for you<a href="self-improvement.html#what-self-improvement-will-do-for-you" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Like I’ve mentioned a million times already, Self Improvement gives you the power to transform your life and shape it as you desire. Above any and all kinds of improvement you can make and progress you can expect to see, I think the biggest benefit of Self Improvement is that it puts things into perspective and gives you total control over your life. Having total control over your life allows you to work towards improving practically every aspect of your life with ease, and even bypass cravings and negative emotions that keep you stuck where you don’t want to be.</p>
<p>By having such control, you gain the ability to turn yourself into EXACTLY whom you want to be: your physique, your personality, the activities that you do, how people view you and even your mindset and the thoughts you think come under your direct control. Think about this for a while. With time and the right kind of effort, you can go from being a shy, nervous little guy who plays video games all day and spends no time outside, to a confident, extroverted, social-butterfly-type person who commands respect among his peers and is treated like a leader by them.</p>
<p>This may sound outlandish to you, or you might think it’s possible for others but not for yourself. However, trust me when I say this, if you simply <strong>BELIEVE</strong> in your ability and in the effectiveness of this guide, and follow this practical guide fully, you will see major progress and positive changes in your life that you never would have anticipated, even in your wildest dreams. So, join me on this journey and allow your upcoming progress to surprise you and those around you.</p>
</div>
<div id="a-warning" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="2.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.4</span> A Warning<a href="self-improvement.html#a-warning" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>I need to make this clear before we get into the practical stuff. Self Improvement is notable for a specific <strong>negative side-effect</strong>, so I’m mentioning it right here in order to make sure you don’t fall down this hole.</p>
<p>On this journey you will see yourself transform into a much better self; you will have a lot less worries, a lot of things to be proud of, and overall a great sense of confidence in yourself and your abilities. Do not allow this success to blind you and inflate your ego. Considering yourself a God and above everyone else is the biggest pitfall people fall into while on this journey, and this has two major problems.</p>
<p><strong>One</strong>, people like you less for it, and trust me when I say that people can sense how you view them as a person. Someone who views him/herself as better than others is not someone who can easily garner respect and be liked by others, and this cuts you off from being able to establish deep social connections sometimes. By all means tell others about the journey and about the progress you’ve made, but don’t assume a sense of superiority due to it. Not only does it make you less likeable of a person, but it also creates a vulnerable need to feed the narrative that you’re better than everyone, eventually leading to feelings of insecurity. <strong>Two</strong>, it blinds your potential for progress and keeps you stuck where you are. If you regard yourself to already be better than everyone else, you will no longer want to improve yourself, and so this kills any further progress and any fulfillment you would’ve gotten from that journey.</p>
<p>So recognize that all you’re doing on this journey is advancing more of your potential as a human being, and that doesn’t inherently make you <em>better</em> than someone else. The process of developing and improving ourselves is aimed at learning new things about ourselves and the world around us, and the sense of purpose gained from that is what makes life enjoyable, not the act of becoming better than everyone else.</p>
