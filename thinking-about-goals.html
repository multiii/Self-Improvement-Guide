<p>Goals are essential to success because they provide us with a direction to follow. If we want to attain total success, but don’t have goals in place to know exactly what that success concretely looks like, we will make little progress because we only have a vague idea of what we want.</p>
<p>Moreover, goals have been proven to be essential to keep us functioning and feel a sense of purpose. We have a feeling of total attunement with our environment when we are totally locked in and working towards making our goals a reality. This is known as the “Flow State”, and it is one of the most blissful and <em>complete</em> states of consciousness known to man.</p>
<p>Continually working towards our goals by spending our times purposefully and enjoying every minute of goal chasing not only makes us feel fulfilled and filled with energy during the present, but also keeps us hopeful and <em>nostalgic</em> for the future, since we know we will be able to carve a better future for ourselves by simply doing what we currently love.</p>
<p>This is the beauty of this journey, and I wish this state of enlightenement and total consciousness to everyone reading this. Know that this is possible to attain. Realize that millions of people who were defeated and washed away by life got back up only to realize this very dream, simply by holding on and believing in themselves.</p>
<div id="how-to-set-and-achieve-goals" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="8.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">8.1</span> How to set and achieve goals?<a href="thinking-about-goals.html#how-to-set-and-achieve-goals" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Now this sounds great and all, but how do we actually go about setting purposeful goals and enjoying the goal chasing process.</p>
<p>We will start off by imagining the ideal future. The best case scenario. Imagine where you wish to be 10 years from now, or heck, maybe even imagine your perfect future 1 month from now. Whatever it is, let your imagination run wild and fully capture the extent to which you wish to make a transformation in your life.</p>
<p>Now, identify the goals that would lead you to such a future. For example, let’s say you imagined yourself as someone with a super muscular physique relaxing in a big mansion with a bunch of friends. In that case, your goals would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Building an attractive, muscular physique</li>
<li>Becoming rich enough to afford a big mansion</li>
<li>Having great social skills and a lot of friends</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we will break down each of your goals into 3 aspects to focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>mini-goals</strong> (habits) that will help you reach the goal</li>
<li>The <strong>environment</strong> where you will be able to work on these mini-goals</li>
<li><strong>Researching</strong> and learning about the core skills necessary for the goal and mini-goals</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s take a look at each of these aspects for our first hypothetical goal. For the first goal of building a muscular physique, let’s first recognize that this goal falls under the Core Pillar of Physical Health. You will first start by signing up at a gym, or planning to work out elsewhere depending on your preferences <strong>(Environment)</strong>. Next, for your first workout session, simply get any work done <strong>(Mini-goals)</strong>. Do 10 pushups and call it a day. Maybe if you’re more experienced, plan a basic workout routine and follow it. Just do what you can and what doesn’t overwhelm you. Now, slowly begin doing some research about workouts <strong>(Research)</strong>. Watch YouTube videos about workout splits and what types of workouts to do. You will slowly begin to learn some information on workouts. At the same time, apply your new found knowledge and slowly upgrade your workouts.</p>
<p>As you can see, we begin by straight up jumping into the action, even if you might not know what exactly to do. This is okay, and the truth is, <strong>no one knows what exactly to do in the beginning.</strong> By simply showing up and doing any work, you start to build consistency. This, coupled with watching a YouTube here and there about workouts when you’re bored, slowly starts to educate you on the topic, and in no time you’ll become an expert on everything about workouts. You will slowly want to start progressively overloading your habit with time, making sure that you don’t feel overwhelmed and that it doesn’t feel like a chore. If it does, tone things down for a while. You really don’t have to do intense workouts for the rest of your life, and the truth is that almost no one does. All that matters is that you can get at least some work in, but do so consistently. Simply following everything that I’ve outlined in this page will get you ahead of 90% of people in the gym, and of course this format and these pricinples apply to every other goal you set.</p>
<p>Let’s quickly go over the goal of having a lot of friends as well. If you’re in school, well you’ve already got your environment for you and so you might not need to do anything. If you’re an adult, you could try networking in the workplace, or maybe sign up at some local clubs or activities that you’re interested in. Next, your mini-goals will be things like introducing yourself to new people, having interesting conversations, organizing to meetups with people in the future, on so on. Some of these may feel awkward at first, but it’s a good thing if they do, since that simply means that you’re getting over your resistances and gaining a lot of XP in this skill. Awkwardness after doing something uncomfortable is sorta like muscle soreness after a workout. Your body is compensating and trying to recover after doing something it’s never done before, but all this means is that after the awkwardness passes, you’ll be levelled up and able to do such things with ease the next time. Finally, you will need to read the essential social skills books for success in this skill. Here are the best books that’ll give you the best return on your investment:</p>
