<p><b>
NOTE: The information in this section is rather unorthodox and might not click at first, since it covers some experientially heavy topics. At any rate, I urge you to read this with an open mind and not attach yourself too much to the words but rather what the words aim to point you towards!
</b></p>
<p>I consider this to be the most important section of the entire book. If you’re currently reading this, there’s a high likelihood that more will be added to this section in the near future, and the topics explored here will be further explored.</p>
<p>We will look into certain beliefs, perspectives and practices that have helped me as per my personal experiences. The things you will learn here may seem rather unorthodox, but they are definitely powerful and have the ability to bring meaningful change as well as dissolve problems that you might have brought you much trouble.</p>
<p>Do keep in mind that although this section will act as an introduction to the art of self-inquiry and the practices of acceptance, much of what is said here might not make full sense or you might not understand its complete meaning unless you spend time in silence practicing mindfulness meditation and inquiry into the nature of your self. Further resources to help you on this quest will be linked at the end of this section. While you read the information presented below, view everything with an open mind, and watch any resistance or judgements you have to it, since that might end up aiding you in learning more about yourself than you currently know.</p>
<div id="all-that-exists-is-now" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="10.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.1</span> All that exists is Now<a href="seeking-tranquility.html#all-that-exists-is-now" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>I will begin this section with a simple realization, but one that isn’t registered by the majority of people. As long as our experiences are concerned, past and future are completely non-existant in their true form. All that we experience is the present: the Now. Yeah it’s true that we can remember past memories, or anticipate future events, but these are nothing more than a mere mental image: one that isn’t wholly accurate, and definitely isn’t the real deal. All that we have is the Now.</p>
<p>We can experience a state of great aliveness, a state of complete consciousness, a state of Being, if we fully immerse ourselves in the Now and let go of all temporal worries <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-synchronize">Kiken et al. 2017</a>)</span>. All of us obviously need the concept of time for things like making an appointment or planning a trip, and it’s okay to use time for such matters. But a problem arises when we begin to dwell on time, dwell on past and future. If we set a goal for the future, that’s okay, but obsessing over the goal, perhaps because we’re seeking a sense of fulfillment or happiness from it will result in negative emotions. This is because, the present will then become nothing more than a stepping stone to our future of fulfillment, and so we will begin to mentally live in our image of the future, neglecting the Now and the bliss that comes with fully witnessing it.</p>
<p>Some people love to take part in activities that can potentially be life-threatening, such as car racing, rock climbing, sky diving, etc. They do this, because such activities force them fully into the Now; all their temporal worries dissapear and they enter a state which is free of thinking and free of problems <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rockclimbing">Zenou 2022</a>)</span>. By letting go of time and delving deeply into the Now, we can enter this highly sought after state and remain in it throughout our day.</p>
</div>
<div id="disidentifying-from-the-mind" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="10.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.2</span> Disidentifying from the Mind<a href="seeking-tranquility.html#disidentifying-from-the-mind" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have probably come across ‘mad’ people in the street incessantly talking or
muttering to themselves. Well, that’s not much different from what you and all other”normal” people do, except that you don’t do it out loud. The voice comments,
speculates, judges, compares, complains, likes, dislikes, and so on. The voice isn’t
necessarily relevant to the situation you find yourself in at the time; it may be
reviving the recent or distant past or rehearsing or imagining possible future
situations.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-quote1">Tolle 1999f</a> )</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We believe that we think our thoughts, and this is the core error. We don’t actually do so, and the truth is that thoughts are simply subconscious appearances that show up in our field of consciousness, like how the sounds we hear appear in our field of consciousness. Identification with our thoughts results in compulsive thoughts <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-thoughts">Ayan 2018</a>)</span>. Our mind (thoughts &amp; emotions) is our biggest obstacle to experiencing a total state of Being: the feeling experienced by delving deep into the Now and experiencing your presence. Disidentifying from our mind makes us no longer care about the incessant chattering of the mind, the images it projects and the words it uses which are simply signposts that describe the real experiences and things in nature. Instead of listening to these descriptions and false images, we can choose to delve deep into the Now and experience, feel and know these things from a firsthand perspective instead. Whenever we stop to notice a beautiful sight, or appreciate a great piece of music, we are able to feel that sense of beauty because we move out of the realm of our mind and truly experience life for a split second <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-beauty">Tolle 1999e</a>)</span>. Now think about how beautiful and rich your life experiences would be if you remain in the realm of life and out of your mind throughout the day.</p>
<p>The majority of negative emotions (anxiety, tension, worry) and pain (both physical and emotional) that is experiences by humans is a result of deep mind identification. Such pain is always a form of resistance to the Now: on the mental level it’s a form of judgement and on the emotional level it’s a form of negativity. All that it takes to dissolve these negative states is total acceptance of the Now. By watching our emotional states consciously and without allowing thought or judgement to slip in, we can quickly dissolve any form of tension, worry, or other emotional pain <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-emotions">Moyer 2023</a>)</span>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Focus attention on the feeling inside you. Know that
it is the [emotional pain]. Accept that it is there. Don’t think about it - don’t let the feeling
turn into thinking. Don’t judge or analyze. Don’t make an identity for yourself out of
it. Stay present, and continue to be the observer of what is happening inside you.
Become aware not only of the emotional pain but also of ‘the one who observes,’ the
silent watcher. This is the power of the Now, the power of your own conscious
presence. Then see what happens.” <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-quote2">Tolle 1999c</a>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might see that some people talk about how everything in their life sucks and how they wish it could be better. But taking a deeper look into their actions and decisions shows that they actually make the problem worse for themselves, and don’t actually work towards improving their situation. Some people complain about having abusive partners, and rightfully so, but they seem to continue getting into more such relationships, even though that would only cause them more suffering. This seems to happen because of their attachment to their emotional pain. When emotional pain accumulates in an individual, it forms a pain-body which wants to survive, and so, convinces the individual that it is them. The individual then continues to seek pain at the same emotional wavelength as the pain body <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-painbody">Tolle 1999d</a>)</span>. This explains why some individuals seem to only worsen their issues that they seem to keen on wanting to get rid of. You can dissolve such pain bodies and such tendencies from yourself by once again practicing the afforementioned method of feeling the emotional pain inside you and simply watching it without thinking or judging. Simply the act of witnessing your pain body makes you realize that you are seperate from it, and this instantly cures you of it. At first, there may be greater resistance and you may feel a greater negative feeling take over you, but persisting for a short while longer seems to completely get rid of it, and you will be greeted with a satisfying feeling of tranquility.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.3</span> The Joy of Being<a href="seeking-tranquility.html#the-joy-of-being" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Once you fully accept the conditions of the present moment, and delve deeply into your experience, you will experience the joy of Being. There will be a sense of ease and lightness in what you’re doing <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-acceptance2">Taylor 2013</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Upon delving deeply into the Now and paying full conscious attention to your experience, you can begin to delve deeper into the inner body. This gives you a sense of connectedness both with yourself, and your witnessed experiences. You can do this by directing your attention into the body, and feeling the energy within. <em>“The feeling of your inner body is formless, limitless, and unfathomable. You can always go into it more deeply. If you cannot feel very much at this stage, pay attention to whatever you can feel.”</em></p>
<p>By having a sense of deep connectedness with your inner body, you empower yourself, enabling your life-situation to be deeply transformed. Similar to how attachment to your pain attracts more pain by bringing negative experiences and emotions, deeply settling into the energy of your body and accepting it fully attracts higher level experiences and emotions.</p>

<div id="the-higher-good" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="10.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">10.4</span> The Higher Good<a href="seeking-tranquility.html#the-higher-good" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>It is futile to categorize conditions and experiences into good and bad. For many people, illness, loss and other such conditions that are generally considered bad have helped them overcome obstacles and have ended up making their lives better. Hence, if we see them from a higher perspective, conditions are neither good nor bad, and complete acceptance of whatever comes our way ensures that they remain that way. If we fully accept all conditions, they can’t possibly affect us in a negative way, so all conditions can be considered to belong to a class of higher good.</p>
<p>Impermanence is the law of nature. Everything starts and finally comes to an end. We must learn to accept things for simply existing and for what they are, and allow them to pass by after a while, realizing that nothing is permanent. The law of impermanence is necessary to maintain stability. For example, everything that grows eventually has to die. If cells continued to grow endlessly without dying, eventually we would have no space on our planet to support more live. Cancer is very literally the disease where cells grow continuously to no end, and we all know how dangerous that is.</p>
<p>Ultimately, accepting everything that comes our way and going with the flow of life allows nature to work for us rather than against us, and ensures that we will remain at peace and happy no matter what conditions and situations we face. This is the only sane way to live, and is the only way to minimize pain and negativity in our lives.</p>
