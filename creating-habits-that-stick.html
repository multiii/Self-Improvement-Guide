<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 6</span> Creating Habits that Stick<a href="creating-habits-that-stick.html#creating-habits-that-stick" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h1>
<p>A few years ago, I wanted to get started on my glow up journey to transform myself. I learned about weightlifting and certain exercises to improve your looks, and although I told myself that I was going to start implementing them, I never did. Months went by and I still kept telling myself that I will eventually start doing these things consistently for hours at a time and that everything will improve then. I was piling work onto my future self. I was procrastinating.</p>
<p>This section will be your practical guide to killing procrastination and getting things done. No more thoughts of “I’ll do this tomorrow” will exist after this. I hope you implement the advice given below and incorporate the right habits that will take you to the top.</p>
<p>P.S. I have included a list of habits at the bottom of this section that will drastically improve your life in various ways. Don’t forget to check that out at the end.</p>
<div id="doing-less-work-for-your-benefit" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="6.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Doing less work for your benefit<a href="creating-habits-that-stick.html#doing-less-work-for-your-benefit" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Oftentimes we procrastinate because our brain thinks the task will be too hard to do for that long. So, here’s what you can do. Tell yourself that you’ll only do the task for a fixed amount of time, and that you can stop after the time runs out if you want to.</p>
<p>Let’s say you want to start doing jawline exercises (<em>by the way, most advice when you search this up on Google says that jawline exercises are pointless or even dangerous, but my personal experience says that doing the right ones can play a massive role</em>). You find a routine that takes about 15 minutes everyday, but you keep putting it off for later because it’s hard for you to commit to spending that much time towards this new practice everyday.</p>
<p>What you should do is, spend 2 minutes everyday for the first few weeks practicing the exercises in a more limited manner. Rather than doing 20 repetitions of each seperate exercises, maybe just do 5, and then skip a few to be able to finish up within 2 minutes. Brushing your teeth takes only 2 minutes, and you can hopefully do that effortlessly everyday, so doing this shouldn’t be too hard either. Your mind might tell you that 2 minutes of exercises are pointless, but don’t listen to your mind. Your mind is what causes you to procrastinate in the first place. If your mind gave you solid advice, you wouldn’t have come here, so stop listening to your mind and focus on the advice provided here instead.</p>
<p>By doing a more limited workout, which is also easier, you’re able to build consistency. Consistency is what matters the most when you first start out trying to build a new habit. All you need to do is show up, and the gains will eventually make their way.</p>
<p>Once you get comfortable, maybe even too comfortable, performing the habit for 2 minutes, bump it up a little. Maybe move up to 3 minutes, or even 5. Then spend some more days performing the habit for this long. And once you’re comfortable with that too, bump it up again until you hit 15 minutes. This is called progressive overload. It takes away the strain of doing difficult tasks by making it all easy, while building consistency and also allowing you to do the needed work.</p>
</div>
<div id="schedule-a-time-for-your-habit" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="6.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Schedule a time for your habit<a href="creating-habits-that-stick.html#schedule-a-time-for-your-habit" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Now, that’s cool and all. Although you might also find yourself open to do the habit for a short period of time, you might not know when exactly to do it. You may end up finding yourself doing the habit only when you feel like it, and if you don’t, you may not do it. Although the task has become easy, you have no idea when to do the task.</p>
<p>This is where scheduling comes in. By fixing a specific time for your task every single day, you can ensure you get the task done. Since the task is easy, you won’t be fooling around trying to make excuses to not do the task. During the designated time, you will be okay with doing the habit since it’s not going to take too long and isn’t likely to be too difficult.</p>
<p>By doing your habit at the same time everyday, the habit slowly becomes part of your daily routine. Soon, you might find yourself automatically jumping to the task at the specified time, and doing the task itself might become effortless for you due to the repetition.</p>
</div>
<div id="upgrading-your-self-image" class="section level2 hasAnchor" number="6.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Upgrading your self-image<a href="creating-habits-that-stick.html#upgrading-your-self-image" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Although this might sound great, there is a VERY small chance that even this doesn’t help you out. You might find yourself occasionally skipping the habit or not feeling like doing it even though it’s easy. This is because of your self-image. If you have a strong self-image of someone who doesn’t commit to tasks and always procrastinates, you might find it difficult to break out of that identity.</p>
<p>Someone who wants to work out but thinks he doesn’t like the gym might never be able to consistently work out. But if that same person changes his self-image to that of a person who loves working out and thrives in the bodybuilding environment, he will find it super easy and even exciting to work out.</p>
<p>This will take some effort on your part. You can practice visualization to alter your self-image to that of the person you want to be. It also just takes a simple realization of the truth. The perception of your identity is simply based on how you view the truth, but your view is often limited. A person might think he doesn’t like the gym because it reminds him of his time in grade school when he was ridiculed for being bad at sports. The gym doesn’t actually reflect that, and it can mean different things for him if he chooses to change his perspective, maybe instead beginning to consciously remind himself of the fun time he had playing a sport with Dad or a group workout with friends when he didn’t really know what he was doing, but enjoyed spending time with them anyways.</p>
<p>This requires you to alter your perception of the past. Learn to accept things as they were, being grateful for how they played out because without hardships, you wouldn’t have the stimulus needed to push yourself towards finding a way to success. Also, things like introspection, journaling and shadow work are of great help for this purpose. Try to let go of all negative perceptions, self-images and identities of yourself and other things. This will make your goal, and the self-improvement journey as a whole, a lot more fulfilling and relieving.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">6.4</span> The Habits List<a href="creating-habits-that-stick.html#the-habits-list" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The habits and practices mentioned below are great tools to improving various spheres of your life. I will specify which sphere(s) of life they specifically target in parentheses. Additional links, if required, will be provided as hyperlinks directly on the specific habits.</p>
<p>This list won’t include habits that are mentioned in Section 5: The 2-Week Challenge and Section 9: Intermediate Habits, but those mentioned there are equally as valuable.</p>
<p>Note: I will have to provide a special warning here. Be careful with Mewing and the jawline exercises since doing them wrong can lead to undesirable effects, and can even be harmful. Practice them at your own descretion.</p>
